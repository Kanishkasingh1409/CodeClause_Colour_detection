# CodeClause_Colour_detection
By clicking on my program, which I built, will instantly give you the colour's name. We therefore have a data file for this that includes the name of the colour and its values. The shortest path from each colour will then be determined by calculating its distance. To break the cycle, press the "esc" key.
